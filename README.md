-pyttsx3 / macOS say command : for text-to-speech responses
-webbrowser : for opening websites
-datetime : for time and date functionalities
-pywhatkit : for playing YouTube music
-os / platform : for system-level interactions
-subprocess : to execute system commands

-Opens popular websites or any domain you say (even dot com, dot in, etc.)
-Searches and plays music on YouTube based on your request
-Tells dark humor jokes (intended for mature users)
-Says responses aloud using your system's voice engine
-Provides a help guide with a list of supported commands

#Example Voice Commands
“What time is it?”
“Tell me today’s date”
“Play Shape of You”
“Open Google”
“Visit my college website dot ac dot in”

“Goodbye”

#How to Run
-Make sure Python and all required libraries are installed

-The assistant will respond with voice and perform the requested tasks

#Note: On macOS, it uses the say command for voice output. You can replace this with pyttsx3 or other TTS libraries on Windows/Linux.
